FOREWORDEntomologists oftheDivision ofPlantIndustry,Florida Department of Agriculture, provideanidentification service fortheState of Florida of insects, mites, spiders, scor pions, millipedes, centipedes,andotherar thropods. Spiders, particularly, seemtoarousethecuriosity ofmanypeople whosubmitspecimens for identificationandrequestcontrol recommendations. Likethe,snakes,spidersarelittleunderstoodand muchmaligned bymostpeople, usually with littleornojustification.Sofar as known, withtheexception ofthemembers of two small families, all spidershavepoison glands. Thevenomisusedto killtheirprey }':f andas a means of defense. However, only a few species,suchas certaintarantulasandotherspiders ofthetropics, produce a venomvirulentenoughtobe harmful to man. More over,mostspecies are too timid and donotattemptto bite evenwhenhandled roughly. '--YIn Florida, onlythespiders belongingtothegroup commonly called widowsarecapable of inflicting a bite serioustoman. The bite '. ofthelarger wolf spidersandthefearsome looking silk spider is little worsethanthestingof a bee or wasp. Mostothernative spiders seldom bite man,andmanyare in capable of doing so. Whiletheincidence of bites by widow spiders isnothigh,thewidow spiders are fairly commoninFlorida,andquestions regardingthemare received frequently bytheentomologists oftheDivision ofPlantIndustrywho curatetheFlorida State Collectionof Arthropods. The seriousness ofthebite of amaturefemale widow spider sug geststhatthegeneral publicshouldbe cor rectly informed concerning this groupofspiders, includingtheirpromptrecognitionandthetreatmentsrecommended for bites.TheWidowSpiders'ofFloridaisthesec ondinanirregularlyappearing series of publications relating to the insectsandotherarthropods of Floridaandneighboringlandareas-thesoutheasternUnited States,theBahamaIslands,theGreaterandLesserAn tilles,andthelandareasinandroundtheGulf ofMexico-withemphasisontaxonomy, ecology, biology,andzoogeography.

THE WIDOW SPIDERS OF FLORIDAJohnD.McCrone2KarlJ.Stone 3 Introduction:There are four species oftheblack widowgenusLatrodectusthatare known to occurinFlorida:thesouthernblack widow,Latrodectus mactans(Fabri cius);thenorthernblack widow,L.variolusWalckenaer;thered widow,L.bishopiKas ton;andthebrown widow,L.geometricusC.L. Koch. Sincetheimmatures andtheadultmaleLatrodectusdonotpose a publichealthproblem, descriptionsinthis publica tion are limited tothemature females. Males cannot be identified to species easily.The Genus:The spidersinthisgenusare fairly large,theoveralllengthwith legs ex tended is aboutlY2inches.Theyhave a smallcephalothoraxand alarge,high, smooth, subglobose abdomen. Althoughthewhole body is densely covered withshortalmost microscopic hairs,thespiders have ashinynaked appearance. Some ofthecharac ters used to separatethespecies are difficult to see without a microscope and special tech niques. When possible, specimens should be capturedandplacedina vialorbottle of70%alcohol,suchas rubbing alcohol,andsubmitted for positive identification by a specialist. Fortunately', however,inFloridaitis possible to identifymostadult female specimens bymeansof their distinctive color patterns. LATRODECTUS MACTANS,TheSouthern Black WidowIdentification:The body is glossy black to sepia. The dorsum oftheabdomen is usually free of markings,althoughoccasionallythereareremnantsoftheimmature color pattern. There is a red hourglass marking ontheven-1Contribution No.53,Entomology Section, Divi sion ofPlantIndustry2AssociateProfessorof Biology, Florida PresbyterianCollege, St.Petersburg,Florida 3Entomologist, Division 'ofPlantIndustry,Florida Department of Agriculture, Gainesville, Florida.teroftheabdomenanda red spot ontheposterior end oftheabdomenjustabovethespinnerets.Distribution:This isthemostwidespread species ofthegenusinFlorida. Ithas beentakeninmostcountiesandprobably occursinall of them. Theotherspecies have more limited distributions.HabitatandLifeHistory:Thesouthernblack widow occupies a large variety of habi tats, usuallynearhumanhabitation orinnewly disturbed areas.Itmakesanirregular web of verytoughsilkinsuchprotected places as stumps, discarded pipe and buildingmaterials,understones,instorm sewersandwatermeterboxes,andunderpark benchesandtables.Itis seldom foundinhousesinFlorida. Connected totheweb is a small silken retreat.InFlorida, this spiderhasnowell defined breeding cycle, andallstages of development can be foundatanytime. The females make several egg sacs duringanextendedperiod aftermating.Theseegg sacs are pear-shapedtoalmost globular, andthetoughpaperyoutercoveringrangesincolor from white to tan. Each sac contains from onehundredto severalhundredyellowish eggs. Often these eggs havebeenparasitizedeitherbydipterousorhymenopterous egg parasites.Inaddition to parasites,themainfactors limiting popula tion size are extreme climatic conditionssuchas extremelyhighorlow humidity and freezing. LATRODECTUS VARIOLUS, TheNorthernBlack WidowIdentification:This specieshasthesame general appearance asL.mactans.Itdiffersinthatthereis a median longitudinal row ofredspotsonthedorsum oftheabdomen, andontheventerthereare two transverseredbars instead ofanhourglass.Distribution:InFlorida,L.variolushasbeen found only west of Tallahassee.Itis

A dome shapedretreatis locatedintheleavesattheendof a branch,andtreads radiateouttoone or more branches. UnlikeL.mactans,L.variolushas a well defined breeding cycle. During MarchandApril,immaturespidersarewidely scatteredinforest litter,andinlatespring, adultsarefoundinthetrees. Mating occursandthemales die immediately afterward. Duringthesummer,adultfemales arefoundintheretreatswith oneormore egg sacs which are similartothoseofL.mactans.By late fall all adults are gone, andverysmall immatures are foundintheforest litter.LATRODECTUS BISHOPI,TheRed WidowIdentification:Thecephalothoraxandlegs arereddishorange.

Service stations are particularly good places to find them. The webs are somewhat likethoseofL.mactansbutare smaller, whilethesilk isnotastoughandtheweb bing is very dirtyandunkempt.Theegg sacs appear very diffl!rent fromthoseofotherLatrodectussp.Insteadofbeingsmooth,theoutside oftheegg sac is covered with little papules.

Medical Importance All four specieshaveverypotentvenoms,butfor a variety of reasons, onlyL.mactansis likely to be involvedina spider bite caseinFlorida.Ifanindividual isbittenbyoneoftheotherspecies,thesame measures recommended forL.mactansbitesshouldbe taken.Thebite ofL.mactansproduces asharppainsimilartoa needlepuncture.Usually this pain disappears rapidly,butitmay per sist forhours.Local muscular cramps are felt15minutesto severalhoursafterthebite.Themusclesmostfrequently affectedarethose-inthethigh, shoulder, and back.Laterseverepainspreadstotheabdomen,andthereis weaknessandtremor.Theab dominal muscles show a boardlike rigidity.

Respiration becomes spasmodic,andthepatientis restlessandanxious. During this period a feeble pulse, cold clammy skin, laboredbreathingand speech,lightstupor,anddelirium may be noted. Convulsions,urinaryretention,shock, cyanosis,nauseaandvomiting, insomnia, and cold sweats alsohavebeenreported. Local measures,suchas thoseusedfor snakebite, donotseem to be effective becausethevenomspreads very rapidly. Medi caltreatmentshouldbesoughtimmediately,andthepatientshould be keptquietandplacedinbed assoonas possible. One vial of Lyovac antiveninshouldbe administeredtopatientsunder14years of age. The acutepainofthemuscle spasmsmaybe relieved by prolonged warm baths, hydrotherapy,ortheintravenousinjection of10%calcium gluconate. Recently,intravenousinjection of10mlof methocarbamol (Robaxine) over a 5-minute period, followed by slow intravenousdrip ofthedruginsodium chloride,hasproved to be very effective. Deathmayoccur fromthevenom, dependinguponthevictim's physical condition, age, andthelocation ofthebite. Complicatingfactorssuchassyphilis,heartdisease,and/orkidney disease coupledwiththeven om may produce a fatality.
